The Container component is used as a consistent wrapper for the app context.

```js
  <Container>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <h3>Sub-section Title</h3>
    <h4>Content Title</h4>
    <p>This is my container, it is fixed to the specific maximum width and standard height.</p>
  </Container>
```
