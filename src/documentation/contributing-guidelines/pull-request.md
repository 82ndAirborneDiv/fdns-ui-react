#### Creating your First Pull Request
 [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) 
 
#### Fork the `FDNS UI` repo
Forking creates a copy of a repository which you can work on. Using this working copy you can then submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and integrated with our master repo. In short the order of operations:

FORK > SYNC > BRANCH > COMMIT > PUSH > PULL REQUEST

#### Keeping Your Fork Up to Date
While this isn't absolutely necessary, if you plan on doing anything more than just a quick fix, you'll want to make sure you keep your fork up to date by tracking the original "upstream" of the repo. To do this, you'll need to add a remote:

```bash
# Fetch from upstream remote
git fetch upstream
```
