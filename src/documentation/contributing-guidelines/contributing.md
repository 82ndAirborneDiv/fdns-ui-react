### Pre-requisites
- _Node:_ `^9.0.0` or higher.
- _Npm:_ `6.0.0` or higher.
- _Yarn:_ `^1.7.0` or higher.

### Getting started
⭐️ Star the project

Clone the project from Github :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/fdns-ui-react.git
cd fdns-ui-react
```

Install dependencies :

```bash
yarn
```

Setup development environment:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Commit messages
Commit messages should follow the  [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/)  so, changelogs could be generated automatically by that. Commit messages are validated automatically upon commit. If you aren’t familiar with the commit message convention, you can use yarn commit (or npm run commit) instead of git commit, which provides an interactive CLI for generating proper commit messages.
