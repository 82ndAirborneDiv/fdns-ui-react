# FDNS UI
## React Component Library and Design Guidelines
### Accessible. Responsive. Secure
`Version 0.8.13`

FDNS UI is a pragmatic component and design library used to build evolving interfaces for public health applications. It utilizes a system of styles, patterns, components and documentation; to provide a unified language and consistent look and feel when designing data-driven applications. This project is built and maintained open-source by the Centers for Disease Control under the CSELS/DHIS.

Our component library and design guidelines system is divided into four sections.
* **Style Guide:** A Style Guide is a set of standards and rules for the formatting of digital interfaces. Representing a subclass in the design system, this static documentation describes the design system itself: how products should look and feel, use cases for UI patterns, correct typographic scales, etc.

* **Pattern Library:** A Pattern library is a collection of functional design modules (components), that appear across or within an application multiple times.

* **Code Components:** A component library is a cloud-based collection of rich UI elements, helping developers and designers more efficiently create immersive user experiences for applications and web. Many popular frameworks have modernized to CBA (Component Based Architecture); React was the original pioneer, moving large page-like interfaces into reusable building blocks.

* **Documentation:** Solid documentation is paramount to a foundational design-system library. Design systems have many versioned visual and technical documents. From step-by-step instructions and getting-started docs, to live demos and architectural diagrams. Detailed-interactive documentation allows teams to successfully understand and build quickly and efficiently.
