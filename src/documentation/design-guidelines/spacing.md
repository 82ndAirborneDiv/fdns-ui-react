Spacing between components in your application is key-element to great design, and is often overlooked. From the height of an input field to the space around buttons, spatial systems set rules for your UI elements.  Component measurements should include uniformed space decisions. This create predictable design rhythms that are visually consistent. Using a spatial guide reduces visual inconsistencies in your application and allows component teams to include UI elements that feel cohesive within the device. 

####  Spatial Systems
Our spacing methods use: grids, keylines, padding and incremental spacing to ratios, containers, and targets. As mentioned in `Layout` above, we use a responsive grid. Individual components focus on padding and margins within the elements container. Base spacing should be set to a minimum 8px. with the suggested minimum element spacing 16px or 24px. 

Material Design does and excellent job descripting each of these elements in our Spatial System. [Spacing methods - Material Design](https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html#spacing)

*Keylines*
Keylines enable the consistent placement of elements outside of the  [layout grid](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html) . They are vertical lines that show where elements are placed in a design that doesn’t align to the grid. Keylines are determined by each element’s distance from the edge of the screen, measured in increments of 8dp.

*Padding*
Padding refers to the space between UI elements. It’s an alternative spacing method to keylines, measured in increments of 8dp or 4dp.

*Margins*
Padding refers to the space between UI elements. It’s an alternative spacing method to keylines, measured in increments of 8dp or 4dp.

*Vertical Spacing*
Vertical spacing refers to the height of a standard element, such as an app bar or list item. The heights of these elements should align to the 8dp grid.

*Increments*
An increment is a measurement used to measure the size and placement of elements in your app.

It has equal height and width. It can be any number, but it’s recommended to use the height of a standard element (such as the app bar) as your increment.
